This dataset includes 3 spreadsheets of 750,000 rows of stock data per sheet. I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year that outputs the following info: 
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The total stock volume of the stock
- The greatest percentage increase & decrease, as well as the greatest total volume
- Each cell in the Yearly Change column is highlighted to indicated either positive or negative change, via conditional formatting within the script 

For this Module 2 challenge, I worked with classmates and a tutor. The project was completed using Microsoft VBA. By working with multiple study groups, we troubleshooted each other's code and learned how we each came up with our code. I met with a tutor twice for this challenge, who helped revise my code, as well as lead me on areas where I struggled for both the practice file (alphabetical testing) and the actual homework file (Multiple year stock data). 

My tutor was able to help me with the following: 
1. Create a for loop to run my code through all sheets 
2. Conditional formatting to change the cell's color to red/green 
3. Conditional formatting to update the number format to "0.00%" 
4. Revised my code to calculate the greatest % increase, decrease, and total volume
